# To-Do

I want to add a feature that doesn't let you click save on the new note popup if a title hasnt been entered. This would be some javascript that says if input is null, add class that disables button. If not null remove that class?

I've gotta make the checkbox update the actual object in the array. Then I can filter for a true value on each object and use the method of splicing bob mentioned
